# TelegramCalendar
  This is a telegram bot that sends all the events of the day from your Google Calendar to the Telegram chat. I created this bot as a tool for online lessons, in fact it sends 5 events (number of lessons I have in a day) and it also sends the Google Meet link for the lesson. Obviously you can change all of this parameters as you need. I used the following APIs:      Google.Apis.Calendar.v3;     Telegram.Bot;
